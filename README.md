# smart-pool-pump app

## Overview

This application is built around the ESP32 and a custom pcb which implements a pool timer function. The application uses 
aws-shadow libraries to connect to an aws iot thing. It updates the thing by providing pump voltage, current, power,
pressure and temperature. It also allows the user to remotely turn on/off the pump. 
Through a web application the user can control the pump from anywhere. 

Please note the application is still in development.

The application integrates the BMP180 sensor (using code provided by OEM). It also uses ADE7912 via SPI to measure
AC voltage, and current. Finally it commands GPIO ports to turn AC relays on/off. 

The application also implements a webserver which allows the user to change the wifi settings. The Access Point is
configured on ip: 192.168.5.1
